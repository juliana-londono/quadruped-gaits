% function [W,W_EI] = graph2net(sA,e,d)
%
% sA = nxn binary adjacency matrix for a directed graph
%      -> can also have t values in [0,1] for interpolation b/w graphs
% e = epsilon value to control synaptic strengths (default: e = 0.25)
%     -> can be a vector of length n, for varied eps_i's, or a scalar
% d = delta value for inhibitory weights (default: d = 2*e)
%     -> can be a vector of length n, for varied delta_i's, or a scalar
%
% W = nxn matrix for a threshold-linear network from directed graph
%     -> this creates W for a CTLN or generalized CTLN
% W_EI = (n+1)x(n+1) matrix for the accompanying E-I network
%
% modified june 22, 2015
% updated dec 30, 2020 to allow generalized sA matrices for interpolation
% updated apr 23, 2022 to fix bug: A was unassigned, now fixed
% updated aug 10, 2023 to remove A since unnecessary
% updated mar 29, 2025 to allow eps and delta (e,d) to be vectors,
% as in generalized CTLNs (gCTLNs)
% comments updated mar 30, 2025
%
% updated may 4, 2025 to create a second E-I matrix, W_EI, with excitatory
% connections and a single I node for global inhibition
% note: W is an nxn matrix, while W_EI is (n+1)x(n+1)
%
% updated may 8, 2025
% last updated may 19, 2025 to ensure W_EI has 0s on the diagonal
